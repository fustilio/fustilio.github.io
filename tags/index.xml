      <description>In a previous hackathon I participated in, there was a project that prototyped the use of machine learning to &amp;ldquo;evolve&amp;rdquo; the capability of in-game AI agents by using user provided input through a Virtual Reality game. I was pretty blown away by the idea of evolution through repetitive training and exposure to user-provided input. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a couple of videos where developers created simulations with Unity and thought that it might be cool to give it a try myself.</description>

I just wanted some place to pen down my ideas and projects before I forget and in true maker spirit I hope to be able to share some of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
