      <description>Hello There I&amp;rsquo;ve just recently graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Engineering) specializing in Interactive Digital Media and am currently working on a variety of small projects while looking for a job that fits!
I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that studying Computer Engineering has given me a wide range of skillsin both hardware and software domains and I&amp;rsquo;m currently interested in developing applications for virtual/augmented reality.</description>

      <description>In a previous hackathon I participated in, there was a project that prototyped the use of machine learning to &amp;ldquo;evolve&amp;rdquo; the capability of in-game AI agents by using user provided input through a Virtual Reality game. I was pretty blown away by the idea of evolution through repetitive training and exposure to user-provided input. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a couple of videos where developers created simulations with Unity and thought that it might be cool to give it a try myself.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally got down to creating this site, without any customization and the entirety of the site is pretty much identical to the example site provided. I just wanted some place to pen down my ideas and projects before I forget and in true maker spirit I hope to be able to share some of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
